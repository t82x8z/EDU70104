Also, please bear in mind that words and ideas generated by some AI make use of other authors' ideas without referencing them, which is controversial in itself and is considered to be a form. of plagiarism and academic misconduct. Please note that students are responsible for the originality and contents of their work. If AI is used, please acknowledge - see examples below:AI Usage Guidelines:1. AI for Idea Generation: You may use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) to help generate ideas for your analysis. For instance, AI may assist in brainstorming various educational philosophies or curriculum models from global contexts.2. AI for Structuring: AI can help you organize your thoughts and structure your essay. For example, you can prompt AI to create an outline for comparing curriculum approaches or aligning learning outcomes.3. Independent Work: Your final analysis and writing must be independent. AI should not write the content of your essay. You are responsible for ensuring the originality and coherence of your submission.4. AI Acknowledgment: You must clearly acknowledge AI use in your assignment. Provide details of how you used AI to support your planning or idea generation.Here is an example of how to do so:
“I used ChatGPT to generate ideas for structuring my discussion on educational philosophies and to research global curriculum examples. All final analysis and writing are my own.”
Example AI Prompts to Guide Students Level 2: AI Planning:1. Generate an outline for comparing different educational philosophies in curriculum design.2. What are some key differences between global curriculum models in primary education?3. Provide a list of potential learning outcomes aligned with constructivist principles.4. How can learning outcomes be aligned with teaching and assessment methods at the course level?”Examples of ChatGPT responses to prompts: Assignment Title:
My Educational Experiences: Evaluating Curriculum DocumentThe intention of this assignment is to evaluate learners' ability to analyze the relationship between educational philosophies, curriculum design, and teaching. Learners are strongly encouraged to draw upon their own past or present academic experiences. If you are currently teaching, you may leverage your current experience, or you may reflect on your own learning experience as a student to address these questions.
